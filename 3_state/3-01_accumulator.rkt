; Exercise 3.1: An accumulator is a procedure that is called
; repeatedly with a single numeric argument and accumu-
; lates its arguments into a sum. Each time it is called, it
; returns the currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure
; make-accumulator that generates accumulators, each main-
; taining an independent sum. ÓÅâe input to make-accumulator
; should specify the initial value of the sum;


(define (make-accumulator initial-value)
    (define (accumulate value)
        (begin
            (set! initial-value (+ initial-value value)))
            initial-value)
    accumulate)

(define a (make-accumulator 111))
(a 0)
(a 100)
(a 1)
(a 10)
